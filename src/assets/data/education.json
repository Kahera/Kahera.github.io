        "description": "During the degree I'm developing skills in writing good and efficient program code in different programming languages. I'm following the process from idea to working program with specialisation in application development. The program provides a foundation in informatics, but with greater emphasis on programming than is usual in such studies. To a large extent, the tools used are the same ones that are used professionally."
